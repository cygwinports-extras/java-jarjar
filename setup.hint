ldesc: "Jar Jar Links is a utility that makes it easy to repackage Java 
libraries and embed them into your own distribution. This is useful for 
two reasons: you can easily ship a single jar file with no external 
dependencies, and you can avoid problems where your library depends on a 
specific version of a library, which may conflict with the dependencies 
of another library."
